## Iris Classifier

This project develops machine learning models to classify iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Models Used
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

## Results
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 100%

Random Forest Accuracy: 100%

Both models correctly classified every test sample. This showsÂ that the Iris dataset is simple, well-separated, and suitable for classification tasks.

## Key Learnings

Accuracy: What fraction of the test flowers were correctly classified? Here, 100% indicates that every flower was correctly predicted.

Confusion Matrix: A table that compares actual and predicted species. Because accuracy is 100%, all predictions are diagonal (no misclassifications).

Observation:

Setosa is very distinct, so it is always classified correctly.

Even Versicolor and Virginica, which normally overlap, were well separated in this split of the dataset.

High accuracy suggests the dataset is not very complex, and even simple models can perform extremely well.
